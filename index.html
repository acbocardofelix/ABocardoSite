            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi! I am a 23 year old Latina with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Application Systems from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas.
                I am looking for a position within the tech field to expand my experience and grow my knowledge in the field, however times are tough!
                I have background in several fields, a jack of all trades. I received a Banking and Finance Certification in 2019, where I 
                interned at Canyon State Credit Union. I have worked in the retail and customer service areas since I was 15. At the age of 20 I 
                joined a team in the Bursar's office at St. Mary's University as a student worker. I assisted the current
                office employees, however in January of 2023 I was offered an official part time position, anfd by the time I graduated in May of 2023, I was a full time 
                Senior Account Specialist. Now you might be wondering why I am looking for a job. I decided to return to Arizona after personal reasons and to
                be close to my parents.</p>
